<objective>
Create the master launch readiness checklist that maps all 28 v1 requirements to their verification methods, evidence sources, and pass/fail status.

Purpose: Provide structured validation framework for go/no-go decision. This document is the single source of truth for launch readiness.

Output: .planning/LAUNCH-READINESS.md with requirements verification matrix, weighted scoring, and verification procedures.
