### Blockers/Concerns

**Launch Hardening Focus:**
This is brownfield work — all features are built. Roadmap focuses on reliability, testing, and polish. No new features should be added during launch prep unless critical for go-live.

**Cross-Phase Dependencies:**
- Phases 8-9 (E2E testing) depend on Phases 1-4 (core hardening) being complete
- Phase 10 (load testing) requires E2E flows validated first
- Phase 12 (launch review) is gate for production deployment
