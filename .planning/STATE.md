## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Date | Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-29 | 01-01 | Partial unique indexes for nullable columns | Standard constraints don't handle NULLs correctly in PostgreSQL |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-01 | RLS allows all authenticated users | No owner_assignments table exists; can restrict later |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-01 | 30-day idempotency retention | Extended from 7 days for extra protection against late duplicates |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-02 | Check idempotency before signature verification | Reduces processing load for replay attacks |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-02 | Fail-open on idempotency errors | Availability over strict deduplication |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-02 | Fire-and-forget email pattern | Ensures webhook responds within 5s timeout |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-03 | Toast notifications for payment errors | User decision: toast (not modal), 5s auto-dismiss, retry button |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-03 | Shared payment-errors.ts utility | Centralized error handling for consistent GA/VIP UX |
| 2026-01-29 | 01-03 | No technical details in error messages | User-friendly messages only ("Payment failed. Please try again.") |

### Pending Todos

- Phase 2 (Email Reliability): Add email retry queue for failed sends

### Blockers/Concerns

**Launch Hardening Focus:**
This is brownfield work — all features are built. Roadmap focuses on reliability, testing, and polish. No new features should be added during launch prep unless critical for go-live.

**Cross-Phase Dependencies:**
- Phases 8-9 (E2E testing) depend on Phases 1-4 (core hardening) being complete
- Phase 10 (load testing) requires E2E flows validated first
- Phase 12 (launch review) is gate for production deployment
